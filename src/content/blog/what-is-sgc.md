# What is SGC?

SGC is a Swedish non-profit organization and Discord community dedicated to providing a safe online space for young people. If you're interested in learning more about our work, you can visit [sgc.se](https://sgc.se/)—please note that the site is only available in Swedish.

I've been involved with SGC since the very beginning of the Discord server, starting as a moderator and later serving as an admin. Although I've stepped back from moderation, I now focus on developer tasks. My main responsibility has been leading the development team, where I've worked extensively on our Discord bot and coordinated teamwork around it.

In addition to software development, I've managed our server computer, which hosts both Minecraft servers and the Discord bot. My experience with SGC has taught me a great deal, and I'm excited to continue contributing to future projects.
