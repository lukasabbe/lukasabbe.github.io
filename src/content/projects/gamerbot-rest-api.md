# Gamerbot-REST-API

This is a REST API for SGC's online services. It's mostly used for SGC's Discord bot.

What is SGC? You can read more in this [blog post](../blog/what-is-sgc.md).

With this project, I have learned how to build an open API that is used every day. I have strengthened my skills in routing with Express.js.

# Public routes

Here is a wiki on how to use them
