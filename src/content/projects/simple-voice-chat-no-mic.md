# Simple voice chat group message system
This is a server-side addon for [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat).

The mod adds a command that allows you to message all users in a voice chat group, in the same way you can message a team with /teammsg.

# Commands

```
/msgvc <message>
```
