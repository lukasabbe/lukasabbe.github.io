# Multiplayer

This mod will need to be on the server to work in multiplayer. 
You don't need the mod to connect to the server. It's totally optional!

# Config

You can change the config with Cloth Config and Modmenu.
You can also edit the file in config dir if you don't want the mods. But they are recommended 
```yml
lectern-toggle: true #To turn off or on lectern support
scale: 10 # Scale text to what you want. (0-20)
```
