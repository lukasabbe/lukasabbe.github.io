# Gamerbot

# Information

This bot is used by the [SGC Discord](https://discord.sgc.se). It has a level system, user management, voice chat features, and more!

In this project I have learned how to make an effective Discord bot with our own API system. The system handles a lot on the server.

What is SGC? You can read more in this [blog post](../blog/what-is-sgc.md).
